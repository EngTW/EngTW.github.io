> # Bypassing Jekyll on GitHub Pages
> It is now possible to completely bypass Jekyll processing on GitHub
> Pages by creating a file named .nojekyll in the root of your pages
> repo and pushing it to GitHub. This should only be necessary if your
> site uses files or directories that start with underscores since
> Jekyll considers these to be special resources and does not copy them
> to the final site.
